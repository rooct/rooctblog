## Quickstart

```
git clone -b lender https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-examples.git lender-scaffold

cd lender-scaffold
```

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn start
```

* In a second terminal window run:

```
yarn fork
```

This branch uses a local fork of mainnet, which is easy to do with Hardhat ([see here to learn more](https://hardhat.org/guides/mainnet-forking.html)). The template configuration uses an Infura node, however this is not a full archive node, so it will only work for an hour or so. To get a long-lasting fork...

* Go to alchemyapi.io and get an API key for mainnet
* Replace the Infura URL with an Alchemy URL with your API key (i.e. [https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/](https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/)\<API\_KEY\_HERE>) into the `fork` script on line 28 of /packages/hardhat/package.json

ðŸ“± Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app

* Send your burner wallet some ETH using the faucet
* Swap some ETH for DAI
* Go to "Lend" and Deposit DAI into Aave
* Borrow whatever assets you want!

Notes:

* The on-chain requests are quite heavy for this branch, so it can sometimes take the mainnet fork a little while to get going - you may need to refresh several times before everything is cached.
