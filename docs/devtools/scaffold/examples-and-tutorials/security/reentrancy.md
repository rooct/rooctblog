## Re-entrancy Example

[What is a Re-Entrancy Attack?](https://quantstamp.com/blog/what-is-a-re-entrancy-attack)

## Tutorial Explanation

The re-enterancy contract is vulnerable through its poorly written withdraw() function. Withdraw\_safe() is not. To test the attack do this:

**Player 1 (usually an incognito tab):**\
****In the re-enterancy contract, Deposit 0.001 ETH (converted into GWEI by clicking \*)\
Verify the amount in the contract is $0.001 (or whatever the price of ETH is)

**Player 2 (attacker):**\
****In the attacker contract, deposit 0.001 ETH as well.\
Verify the contract now has $0.002\
From the attacker contract, withdraw\
Notice the balance of the attacker contract now has 2x the funds it should, and re-enterancy has 0. Also, the Player 1's balance in the contract seems to still be 0.001.

_The takeaway? Follow the checks-effects-interaction pattern in all your functions :)_

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-examples.git reentrancy
cd reentrancy
git checkout reentrancy-example
```

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn start
```

> in a second terminal window:

```
yarn chain
```

> in a third terminal window:

```
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `Attacker.sol` and `Reenterancy.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

📱 Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app

First try interacting with `Reenterancy.sol` directly. You can deposit, check your balance, and withdraw:

For the attack to work, you need to deposit some _extra_ funds so they can be stolen:

Make sure the `Reenterancy.sol` contract has extra funds in it:

Then, deposit a the same amount through the `Attacker.sol`:

Finally, when you withdraw from the `Attacker.sol` it will withdraw once and then _re-enter_ and withdraw _again_:

The `Reenterancy.sol` contract is now empty but the original account that deposited the extra funds _thinks_ they still have a balance:
