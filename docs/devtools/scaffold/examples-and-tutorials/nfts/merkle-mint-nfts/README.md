# üå≤ Merkle Mint NFTs

## Branch Info

**Author: **[Austin Griffith](https://github.com/austintgriffith)****\
**Source code:** [https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-examples/tree/merkle-root-buyer-mints](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth/tree/merkle-root-buyer-mints)\
**Intended audience:** Beginners/Intermediate\
**Topics:** Scaffold-eth basics, NFTs, Merkle Tree

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Quick Start

Deployer pays around (0.283719 ETH \~$500 at todays gas and price) for the initial contract but then NFTs are only minted once a buyer wants them. (The buyer of the NFT pays the gas to mint. \~$55)

### About The Project

This branch uses the concept of [merkel root](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp#:\~:text=A%20Merkle%20root%20is%20a,whole%2C%20undamaged%2C%20and%20unaltered.) to verify on chain NFT minting. So instead of pushing all verfied NFT hashes on-chain which would be quite expensive we generate a merkel root by modifying [these](https://github.com/Uniswap/merkle-distributor/tree/master/src) scripts to make our life easier.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

You have to know what is an ERC721 standard and what is NFT. Please refer to [this](http://erc721.org) and [this](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721) for more information if you are not familiar with these terms.

#### Installation

Let's start our environment for tinkering and exploring how NFT auction would work.

1. Clone the repo first

```
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-example.git buyer-mints-nft
```

1. Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

1. Start local chain ina different terminal

```
yarn chain
```

1. Start your React frontend

```
yarn start
```

1. Deploy your smart contracts to a local blockchain

```
yarn deploy
```

### Smart contracts

Let's navigate to `packages/hardhat/contracts` folder and check out what contracts we have there.

We use a couple of contracts in this dApp.

#### MerkleTreeContract.sol

All the logic that verifies minting a particular NFT sits here. When you run `yarn deploy` a merkel root is generated and then passed in this contracts constructor while deploying.

`claim` is the main function which a buyer can call and mint a particular nft.

```
function claim(uint256 index, string calldata tokenURI, bytes32[] calldata merkleProof)
```

These are the arguments passed while sending the transaction, the merkel prrof and index are generated for each NFT at the time of the proof, navigate through this [file](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth/blob/merkle-root-buyer-mints/packages/hardhat/scripts/deploy.js) for more info.

```
require(MerkleProof.verify(merkleProof, merkleRoot, node), 'MerkleDistributor: Invalid proof.');
```

This is the line where the proof verification takes place so if any NFT which was not a part of the merkel root generation is minted the transaction will revert.

If the proof validates the NFT is then minted to the buyer.

### Practice

When you navigate to the react app on your browser you'll see the NFT's for which the merkel root was generated

üí¶ Use the faucet wallet icon in the bottom left of the frontend to give your address **$1000** in testnet ETH.

üé´ Try to "Mint" an NFT:

and voil√† you see your address as the owner after on-chain verification.
