# ðŸ“¥ Installation

Getting started with Scaffold-eth is super easy. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
First, make sure you have: [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/), [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
{% endhint %}

Open a terminal window and run the following commands:

```text
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth.git
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
```

The above will clone the Scaffold-eth repository and install the necessary dependencies.

Open the scaffold-eth folder and you will find a folder named `packages` which contains a few sub folders. The most important ones that you should focus on when just starting to work with Scaffold-eth are `Hardhat` \(which is where you will write your Solidity smart contracts, deploy and test them\) and `React-app` \(which is where you will build the front-end for your smart contracts\).

Once you are done, you are ready to start \#buidling!
